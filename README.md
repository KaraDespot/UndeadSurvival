## Game Features

- **Weapons**: 4 types of weapons for different combat mechanics. 2 melee weapons, a shovel and a rake, and 2 firearms, a rifle and an assault rifle. Weapons are unlocked randomly as you progress through certain waves (4, 8, 12). Switch weapons using the corresponding numbers on the keyboard.
- **Health Bars**: Health bars for both the player and enemies.
- **Player Orientation**: The player faces the mouse direction (left or right), and firearms aim towards the mouse direction (rotate around the player). Automatic shooting/attacking.
- **Waves**: Each wave has a certain number of enemies. The current wave and remaining number of enemies are displayed on the screen.
- **Health Restoration**: Restore missing health with food that has a certain chance to drop from enemies (meat, chicken legs, pizza, noodles).
